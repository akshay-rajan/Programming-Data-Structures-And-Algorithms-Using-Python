    "* We can keep track of the earliest queen that attacks each square. `attack[i][j] = k` if `(i, j)` was attacked first by queen `k`.\n",
    "* When we remove a queen, reset the attack `attack[i][j] = k` to `-1`\n",
    "* An individual square `(i, j)` could be attacked by upto 4 queens - One queen through each **diagonal** through `(i, j)`.    \n",
